This is the Recipe of my Chocalate Chip Cake :-

Pre heat the oven to 180C/350F.
Grease a 9 X 13 pan with cooking spray and/or line with parchment paper for easier cleanup.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using an electric handheld mixer, combine all of the cake batter ingredients. 
Mix until well-combined, about 2 minutes.
Whisk together the cinnamon and sugar until combined.
Spread half of the batter in the bottom of the prepared pan. 
Sprinkle with half of the cinnamon sugar and then sprinkle half of the chocolate chips over the top.
Spoon the remaining cake batter on top in large dollops and spread evenly to cover.
 Sprinkle with the remaining cinnamon and sugar and chocolate chips.
 Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden on top and set around the edges and a toothpick comes out with only a few moist crumbs (donâ€™t over bake or cake will be dry!). Serve warm or at room temperature.
